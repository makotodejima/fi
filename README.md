If you:

- feel like keeping track of your personal finances in Notion
- are weird enough that you want to use cli to view the data
- don't mind setting up free Postgres DB on Heroku
  you can use it too.

I am hosting "Notion API Worker" myself using Cloudflare, on order to access Notion table data from cli. (https://notion-api.mkd.workers.dev).
This is a neat tool that allows you to access your Notion content, created by [these nice people](https://github.com/splitbee/notion-api-worker)
See the [documentation](https://github.com/splitbee/notion-api-worker) for how to set the token for private pages. For public pages there's no need for authorization.
